        * Minimal TTM
        * Easy to develop and maintain
        * Reduce boilerplate code
        * Configurable
        * Allows our developers to focus on their job instead of trying to understand why code broke down
        * Easy integration with SSO
        * Enable secure & insecure endpoints
        * Monitoring
        * Logging
